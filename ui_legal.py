    # --- SECTION 1: SERVICE DEFINITION ---
    st.header("1. The Service")
    st.markdown("""
    **VerbaPost** ("The Service") provides a legacy preservation platform known as **"The Family Legacy Project."** The Service includes:
    * Automated telephony interviews.
    * AI-powered transcription and formatting.
    * Production of physical manuscripts ("The Keepsake Letter").
    * Temporary digital hosting of media files.
    
    **Nature of Service:** VerbaPost acts as a **Production Studio**, not a permanent data storage facility. Our primary deliverable is the physical manuscript and the downloadable master media file.

    # --- SECTION 2: DATA RETENTION (THE 60-DAY RULE) ---
    st.header("2. Data Retention & Archival Policy")
    st.warning("""
    ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: 60-DAY ACTIVE WINDOW**
    
    VerbaPost guarantees active hosting of your media (audio recordings and digital transcripts) for a period of **60 days** from the date of creation.

    st.markdown("""
    **User Responsibility:**
    It is the sole responsibility of the User (The Heir or Interviewee) to **download and save** a local copy of their audio recordings and transcripts within this 60-day window.
    
    **Purging:**
    After 60 days, audio recordings are deleted — both from VerbaPost and from our telephony provider — to protect client privacy. The printed letter and its transcript are unaffected. VerbaPost is not liable for any data loss resulting from the failure to download content within the active window.

    # --- SECTION 3: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (B2B PROTECTION) ---
    st.header("3. Ownership & Advisor Role")
    st.markdown("""
    **Client Ownership:**
    The content created via the Service (including voice recordings, stories, and transcripts) remains the sole intellectual property of the **Interviewee** and their designated **Heir**.
    
    **The Advisor's Role:**
    If this Service was purchased or sponsored by a Financial Advisor or third-party professional ("The Quarterback"), said Advisor acts solely as a **facilitator**. The Advisor **does not** retain ownership rights to the family's personal stories or data.
