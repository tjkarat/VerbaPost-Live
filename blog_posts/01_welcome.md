Welcome to my new publication. Here I intend to discuss the importance of physical correspondence in a digital age, share tips for recording oral histories, and post updates about the VerbaPost platform.

### Why I Built This
I like to walk the Greenways in and around Nashville. I also like to get letters.

I remember when I was in the Army, getting a letter was the highlight of the day—sometimes the highlight of the week. Getting a letter that had perfume on it could keep me going for seven days straight.

Anyway, I was looking for a way to write a letter while walking on the greenway. That was the impetus for VerbaPost: Record a voice note, come back, transcribe it, edit it, and send it out as a physical letter.

### The Family Archive
After getting some traction with standard letters, I started thinking about two very underserved markets for physical mail. 

The first is the **Family History** letter. Some of my mother's family actually descends from the Oneida community in New York. Back in the 90s, one of my mother's cousins put together a family history and mailed it out to all her cousins. This artifact is important to my mother and me, and it will be handed down to my daughter.

### The End of Life Letter
The other market is the "End of Life" letter. This is a sensitive topic that is better handled by Googling the **Stanford Letter Project**, but I thought this was important enough to build a product around. I wanted to make this available even to those who can no longer hold a pen.

I'll write more on all of these topics later, but thank you for being here and thank you for starting this journey with me. I hope you get many good letters in return for the ones you write here.
