Welcome to my new publication. Here I intend to discuss the importance of physical correspondence in a digital age, tips for recording oral histories, and updates to the VerbaPost platform.

### Why I Built This

I like to walk the Greenways in and around Nashville. I also like to get letters. 

I can remember when I was in the Army, getting a letter was the highlight of the day or week. Getting a letter that had perfume on it could keep me going for an entire week.

Anyway, I was looking for a way I could write a letter while walking on the greenway. That was the impetus of the idea for verbapost.com. Record a .wav or .mp3 and come back, transcribe it, edit it and send it out as a letter.

After getting a little bit of traction with the letters, I thought about two very underserved markets for physical letters. One, the family history letter or series of letters. Some of my mothers family and mine actually descends from the Oneida community in New York. Back in the 90's one of my mothers cousins put together a family history and mailed it out to all her cousins. This artifact is important to my mother and myself and will be handed down to my daughter.

The other market is the end of life letter. This is a sensitive topic that is better handled by googleing the Stanford Letter Project, but I thought this was important enough to have a product that could easily make this available even to those who could not hold a pen.

I'll write more on all of these topics later, but thank you for being here and thank you for starting this journey with me. I hope you get many good letters in return for the ones you write here.
